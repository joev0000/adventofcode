# Advent of Code 2018: Go Edition

This repository is a workspace for the 
[Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) programming challenge.  This year,
I will attempt to solve these challenges while learning the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org).
This will use the new "modules" feature introduced as an experimental feature
as part of Go 1.11.
